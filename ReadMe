Application Level File­Sharing­Protocol with support for download and upload for files and indexed searching

compilation: gcc FTP.c -o ftp -lssl -lcrypto

run using ./a.out <server_port> <server_ip> <client_port> type<"tcp"/"udp">

The possible commands are:-
IndexGet --longlist
IndexGet --shortlist <time1> <time2>
IndexGet --regex <regex>
history

FileUpload <file>

FileDownload <file>

FileHash --verify <file>
FileHash --checkall

Approach:-
There is a fork within the code so that server and client are running simultaniously
Based on the protocol mentioned when the code is run(tcp/udp) Upload/Download takes place

The server has a file permission which will have either "FileUploadAllow" or "FileUploadDeny" in it which allow's or denies uploading of files
